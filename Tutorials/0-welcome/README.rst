Welcome to TensorFlow World
===========================

The tutorials in this section is just a start for going into TensorFlow world.

--------------------------------
How to run the code in Terminal?
--------------------------------

Please root to the ``code/`` directory and run the python script as the general form of below:

.. code:: shell
    
    python [python_code_file.py] --log_dir='absolute/path/to/log_dir'
    

As an example the code can be executed as follows:

.. code:: shell
    
    python 1-welcome.py --log_dir='~/log_dir'

The ``--log_dir`` is to provide the address which the event files (for visualizing in Tensorboard) will be saved.

----------------------------
How to run the code in IDEs?
----------------------------

Since the code is ready-to-go, as long as the TensorFlow can be called in the IDE editor(Pycharm, Spyder,..), the code can be executed successfully.
