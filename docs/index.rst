**Installation and Setup the Environment**

In order to install TensorFlow please refer to the following link:
  
  * `TensorFlow`_

The virtual environment installation is recommended in order to prevent package conflict and having the capacity to customize the working environmen. The TensorFlow version employed for these tutorials was `0.12` how ever the files have been transformed and tested in TensorFlow version `1.0` using the following instructions:

  * `Transitioning to TensorFlow 1.0 <https://www.tensorflow.org/install/migration/>`_
