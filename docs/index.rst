## Installation and Setup the Environment

In order to install TensorFlow please refer to the following link:
* [TensorFlow Installation](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/)

The virtual environment installation is recommended in order to prevent package conflict and having the capacity to customize the working environmen.

The TensorFlow version employed for these tutorials was `0.12` how ever the files have been transformed and tested in TensorFlow version `1.0` using the following instructions:
* [Transitioning to TensorFlow 1.0](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/migration)
